This repository contains a basic mpv-setup with some changed hotkeys, added settings and added scripts. Tip, if your distro uses pipewire and you have problems with your soundcard then use "mpv --ao=pulse" to start mpv, it was required for my Soundblaster USB-soundcard.

Added scripts: 
- go to the next or previous video in a directory, now with < and > 
- go to another chapter in a video (YouTube)
- go to another video in a playslit (by opening a playlist-link from YouTube) in mpv

Pause with RMB because the LMB was required for the 2nd and 3rd script.
