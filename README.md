This repository contains a basic mpv-setup with some changed hotkeys, added settings and added scripts. Tip, if your distro uses pipewire and you have problems with your soundcard then use "mpv --ao=pulse" to start mpv, it was required for my Soundblaster USB-soundcard.

Added scripts: 
- go to the next or previous video in a directory, now with < and > 
- go to another chapter in a video (YouTube)
- go to another video in a playslit (by opening a playlist-link from YouTube) in mpv

Pause with RMB because the LMB was required for the 2nd and 3rd script. 

Basic hotkeys: 
- pause: space/RMB/k
- skip time to a few seconds further: right arrow and l, alternatively shift+left/right for larger time-jumps (30 seconds give and take, it has to do with how videos are encoded)
- skip time to a few seconds earlier: left arrow and h
- volume: up and down arrow
- quit and remember time and values of volume and subtitles and all that for later: q
- quit and don't remember all that: shift+Q
- change fontsize of subtitles: shift+f/g
- cycle through audio tracks or subtitles, there are hotkeys for it but you can also just click on the bar in the bottom 
- change speed: [ and ]
